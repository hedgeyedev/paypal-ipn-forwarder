# A Proxy to Forward your PayPal Sandbox's IPN's to your Development Machine

## The Problem!

You can already set up PayPal sandboxes to interact with your credit-card and other monetary handlings.
Indeed, your development machine can "talk" directly w/ the sandbox.  However, if your production system
receives IPN notifications from PayPal, you have probably already encountered the following problem:

Can the PayPal sandbox "talk" directly to your development computer?  Not unless your development computer has a static IP address
(which many find problematic -- security concerns, etc) or a public domain.

Hence, if not, then you know you are unable to do "end-to-end" testing because you cannot test the PayPal IPN
notification.

So, you're stuck, unless you can find a way to forward PayPal sandbox IPN addresses to your development computer.

## The Solution!

In addition to setting up this tool, you need a public facing *server*.  A cloud-based server
such as Heroku will work fine. The gem in this project will operate as a Sinatra
server to receive and queue the PayPal IPN requests on the server.

The gem will be run on you development machine as well; it will
send HTTP requests to this public facing server to retrieve the
IPN records in the *server*'s queue.  For each IPN record retrieved, the gem will
forward it to your PayPal client as though PayPal had sent it directly.


Your PayPal client will need to be modified in order to not send out responses to the PayPal sandboxs.

### In More Detail

There are three main components which interact in order to make this process work. They are: **Paypal**, 
**Server**, and the **Development Computer**

####PayPal
The *PayPal sandbox* that you want to include in your end-to-end testing.

####Server
This gem implements a Sinatra server for the *PayPal sandbox* that stores the IPNs in a queue.  This Sinatra app
must run on a server exposed to the *PayPal sandbox* and have capability to respond to requests sent by the *Development Computer*.

####Development Computer
The *Development Computer* is the local machine that a developer uses for everyday work. It needs to have a internet connection
in order to be able to interact with the *server*.

### In Minute Detail

Each of the three main components has smaller moving parts inside which interact with each other to make everything run smoothly.


**Server**
- Queue
: Part of the Sinatra server.  The Sinatra server puts IPN requests from the *PayPal sandbox* into the *queue*.  The *router*
retrieves them.

**Development Computer**
- Router
: Part of the gem running as a process on the development computer.  It retrieves IPNs from the *queue* and relays them
as requests to the developer's *PayPal client*.

- PayPal Client
: Part of the developer's business application, running on the develper's computer,
that receives and processes IPN requests from (normally) the *PayPal sandbox*.
Of course, in this case, it will be receiving the requests from the *router* instead.

The sequence diagram shows how the messages are exchanged.

Notice some assumptions that are implied from this flow:

1.  This setup assumes that all requests are successful.  This is a tradeoff to prevent the multiple hops and router queuing
    from inadvertently timing out the PayPal sandbox's request.  Hence, for this reason, the *server* completes the HTTP cycle
    as soon as it's stored the IPN into the queue.

1.  The *PayPal client*'s response is muted. Usually, once the *PayPal client* receives an IPN,
    it conducts a handshake with PayPal to make sure that the IPN is valid. This is not performed during testing.

1.  Lastly, note that the queue is part of the server and is not run outside or independently of the server.

Ultimately, you probably have multiple development computers that you'd like to have a PayPal sandbox for
each one.  The *server* can manage multiple connections; this will be described later.

## Features

1.  This Sinatra app only needs to be set up once to handle multiple PayPal sandboxes
    and multiple development machines.
1.  PayPal IPN's received while the target development machine is unavailable are responded to with a success
    response by this app.  The resulting IPN record is not queued.

## Requirements

If you have these resources, then this project may be useful to you:

1. A publicly-facing server that can host this project's Sinatra gem. Both your PayPal sandbox and development
   computer must be able to perform HTTP requests against this server.

1. This server must have a Ruby 1.9 or later to run this project with, and must be able to accept
   gems (such as [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/#readme)).

## Installation

You will need the identifiers for your PayPal sandboxes and your corresponding
development computers as follows:

### PayPal Sandbox ID

For this, you can use the Secure Merchant Id located which can be found in the PayPal sandbox. In the
profile tab, it is the second item which is presented.

### Development ID

For this, the developer's email is used in order to deliver some notifications and identify the developer.

### Assemble a config.ru file:

On your server, put together this `config.ru` Ruby task:

```ruby
require 'paypal-ipn-proxy'

# Gotta have some kind of security; this is the cheapest.
# Feel free to use something more rigorous.
use Rack::Auth::Basic, YARD_SERVER_TITLE_FOR_LOGIN do |username, password|
  username == 'admin' and password == 'admin'  # Please use creds more challenging than these
end

run PaypalIpnProxy.new
```

### Configure the IPN address in your PayPal sandbox(es).

In each PayPal sandbox, configure the *server*'s URL for PayPal to send the IPN messages to.

[PayPal's guide](https://cms.paypal.com/cms_content/CA/en_US/files/developer/IPNGuide.pdf) describes
how to do this in section 3 on page 23.


### Configure the Router Component on Each Development Computer

This consists of installing the *router* gem and creating two aliases so that the developer does not have to find the id of the
 Sandbox every time that they run the gem.

The aliases should be saved in a config file using:

```bash
alias paypal_testing_on='ruby start_paypal sandbox_id developer_id'
alias paypal_testing_off='ruby stop_paypal sandbox)id developer_id'
```

where sandbox_id is the id of the sandbox that the developer will be using
 and developer_id is the email of the developer. The paypal_tesitng_off alias
 only needs to be used when testing was turned off incorrectly.The correct way to turn off
 testing is by the command:

    stop

 in the same terminal window where testing was occurring. If testing was turned off using [Command][C]
 then the paypal_testing_off alias will turn off test mode on the server.

### Run on Your Server

_NOTE: Recommend using `thin` if you are using more than one PayPal sandbox._

On your server:

      rackup -p <whatever port is set up to receive the PayPal IPN messages> -s thin

### Start your Development computer's Router that talks with the server

Using the alias, run the gem on the Developer's computer. Once started, the gem will alert the developer
if something goes wrong in that terminal window.

### Start your Development computer's server that talks w/ its PayPal sandbox

When you set up recurring payments on PayPal, PayPal will start sending IPN notifications to you whenever
it deems necessary. This will happen, among other activities, when it notifies you that it charged
a credit card or that someone issued a refund on the PayPal sandbox side.

## Capabilities

The gem can handle any reasonable number of Sandbox's running at the same time. Below, is a big picture explanation of
how it occurs:

![2_Developers!](https://rawgithub.com/dostapenko/paypal-ipn-forwarder/server_client_fleshing/doc/seq_diagrams/multiple.svg)

However, two developers can not be using the same sandbox. If this occurs, both users will have their testing session
turned off on the server and an email will be sent to both of them.

### Router interactions

The following flow diagrams illustrate the interactions that the router partakes in:

![No IPN!](https://rawgithub.com/dostapenko/paypal-ipn-forwarder/server_client_fleshing/doc/seq_diagrams/router_server.svg)

If there is an IPN, the following occurs:

Feature: Match PayPal sandboxes with developer computers
  As a developer
  I would like to have my own PayPal sandbox assigned to my local development computer only
  So I can use the sandbox confident that it is not receiving other developers' requests.
  #TODO: Need glossary for 'computer', 'server'
